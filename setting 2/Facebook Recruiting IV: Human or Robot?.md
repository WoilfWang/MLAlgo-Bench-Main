Finally, you need to generate a submission file as specified. The submission file should be named Facebook_Recruiting_IV:_Human_or_Robot?_submission.csv. You should save it to the folder: ../submission_folder.

## Task Description
Ever wonder what it's like to work at Facebook? Facebook and Kaggle are launching an Engineering competition for 2015. Trail blaze your way to the top of the leader board to earn an opportunity at interviewing for a role as a software engineer, working on world class Machine Learning problems. 

In this competition, you'll be chasing down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.

In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient. 

The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity. 

The data in this competition comes from an online platform, not from Facebook.

Please note: You must compete as an individual in recruiting competitions. You may only use the data provided to make your predictions.

##  Evaluation Metric:
Submissions are judged on area under the ROC curve.

Submission File

Each line of your submission should contain an Id and a prediction of the probability that this bidder is a robot. Your submission file must have a header row. The file should have the following format:

    bidder_id,prediction
    38d9e2e83f25229bd75bfcdc39d776bajysie,0.3
    9744d8ea513490911a671959c4a530d8mp2qm,0.0
    dda14384d59bf0b3cb883a7065311dac3toxe,0.9
    ...
    etc

##  Dataset Description:
There are two datasets in this competition. One is a bidder dataset that includes a list of bidder information, including their id, payment account, and address. The other is a bid dataset that includes 7.6 million bids on different auctions. The bids in this dataset are all made by mobile devices.

The online auction platform has a fixed increment of dollar amount for each bid, so it doesn't include an amount for each bid. You are welcome to learn the bidding behavior from the time of the bids, the auction, or the device. 

The data in this competition comes from an online platform, not from Facebook.

File descriptions

    train.csv - the training set from the bidder dataset
    test.csv - the test set from the bidder dataset
    sampleSubmission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
    bids.csv - the bid dataset

Data fields

For the bidder dataset

    bidder_id – Unique identifier of a bidder.
    payment_account – Payment account associated with a bidder. These are obfuscated to protect privacy. 
    address – Mailing address of a bidder. These are obfuscated to protect privacy. 
    outcome – Label of a bidder indicating whether or not it is a robot. Value 1.0 indicates a robot, where value 0.0 indicates human. 
The outcome was half hand labeled, half stats-based. There are two types of "bots" with different levels of proof:

1. Bidders who are identified as bots/fraudulent with clear proof. Their accounts were banned by the auction site.

2. Bidder who may have just started their business/clicks or their stats exceed from system wide average. There are no clear proof that they are bots. 


For the bid dataset

    bid_id - unique id for this bid
    bidder_id – Unique identifier of a bidder (same as the bidder_id used in train.csv and test.csv)
    auction – Unique identifier of an auction
    merchandise –  The category of the auction site campaign, which means the bidder might come to this site by way of searching for "home goods" but ended up bidding for "sporting goods" - and that leads to this field being "home goods". This categorical field could be a search term, or online advertisement. 
    device – Phone model of a visitor
    time - Time that the bid is made (transformed to protect privacy).
    country - The country that the IP belongs to
    ip – IP address of a bidder (obfuscated to protect privacy).
    url - url where the bidder was referred from (obfuscated to protect privacy).

train.csv - column name: bidder_id, payment_account, address, outcome
test.csv - column name: bidder_id, payment_account, address
bids.csv - column name: bid_id, bidder_id, auction, merchandise, device, time, country, ip, url


## Dataset folder Location: 
../../kaggle-data/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot. In this folder, there are the following files you can use: train.csv, sampleSubmission.csv, test.csv, bids.csv

## Solution Description:
Here's a little blurb about how I approached feature generation and cross-validation for this problem:

Project Overview:
The project focuses on distinguishing between bots and humans in online auction environments using various data analysis techniques.

Data Description:

The data consists of bid event records containing auction IDs, user IDs, timestamps, IP addresses, and locations.
There is also a table (denoted as X) that includes bidder IDs, hashed contact and payment information, and a label indicating whether the bidder is a robot or a human.

Feature Identification:
The author identifies several features that are useful in characterizing bidding behavior:

    Median time between a user's bids.
    Mean number of bids per auction by a user.
    Entropy of bids placed across different days of the week.
    Maximum number of bids within a 20-minute span.
    Total number of bids placed by the user.
    Average number of bids per referring URL.
    Number of bids on each of the three weekdays in the dataset.
    Minimum and median times between a user's bid and the previous bid by another user in the same auction.

Data Exploration:

Initial exploration of a sample auction reveals insights such as one bidder dominating the auction with a high number of bids, which could be indicative of bot activity.

Useful observations include the mean number of bids per auction, the time between a user's bid and the previous bid, and the rate at which users place subsequent bids.

Time Information Analysis:

The author converts time values to a more understandable unit (hours) to analyze bidding patterns over time.
A histogram of bids over time reveals three distinct chunks of bidding activity, suggesting that each chunk represents approximately three days of data.
The histogram also shows that bidding activity appears to have a periodic nature, with each chunk containing about three periods of bidding activity.

I used sklearn's RandomForestClassifier. The most useful features I identified were:

    the median time between a user's bid and that user's previous bid
    the mean number of bids a user made per auction
    the entropy for how many bids a user placed on each day of the week
    the means of the per-auction URL entropy and IP entropy for each user
    the maximum number of bids in a 20 min span
    the total number of bids placed by the user
    the average number of bids a user placed per referring URL
    the number of bids placed by the user on each of the three weekdays in the data
    the minimum and median times between a user's bid and the previous bid by another user in the same auction.
    the fraction of IPs used by a bidder which were also used by another user which was a bot

Cross-validation was a bit tricky: I did CV 100 times on different 80-20 splits. My mean CV score was almost the same (+/- 0.003) as my final leaderboard score.

edit to answer some further questions:

In order to convert the time scale to hours, I made a bids/unit time histogram and looked at the periodicity - bidding volumes cycled with a period of one day. There are pretty graphs and more details on my github page.

A concrete example of the entropy is the IP entropy: N!/(N_{IP1}! N{IP2}!... N{IPn}!). N is the total number of bids and N_{IPn} is the total number of bids placed from the nth IP. (Because the entropy is a large number, I used the log of the entropy.) The entropy is a measure of how both randomly distributed the bids are, how many IPs there are and how many bids there are. A bidder that places all their bids from the same IP has an entropy of N!/N! = 1.

I used the simple average of five RandomForestClassifiers (each with a different value for the initialization parameter, random_state) to generate the predictions.

Thanks to everyone else who shared their approaches! I thought that leaving out the bots with only one bid was a clever idea. And I was surprised to see that people got mileage out of the device type..
