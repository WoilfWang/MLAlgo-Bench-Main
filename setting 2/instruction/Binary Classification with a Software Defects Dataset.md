You are given a detailed description of a machine learning task, including the task description, evaluation metrics, dataset details, and a detailed description of a solution.
You should strictly follow the provided solution description to implement it and generate the corresponding code to complete this machine learning task.
You are required to complete this competition using Python. We will provide GPU computing resources, and you can use GPU acceleration for training.
You can use any libraries that might be helpful.
Finally, you need to generate a submission file as specified. The submission file should be named Binary_Classification_with_a_Software_Defects_Dataset_submission.csv. You should save it to the folder: ../submission_folder.

## Task Description
### Synthetically-Generated Datasets
Using synthetic data for Playground competitions allows us to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available. This allows us to host competitions with more interesting datasets than in the past. While there are still challenges with synthetic data generation, the state-of-the-art is much better now than when we started the Tabular Playground Series two years ago, and that goal is to produce datasets that have far fewer artifacts. Please feel free to give us feedback on the datasets for the different competitions so that we can continue to improve!

##  Evaluation Metric:
Submissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.

### Submission File
For each id in the test set, you must predict the probability for the target variable defects. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

    id,defects
    101763,0.5
    101764,0.5
    101765,0.5
    etc.


##  Dataset Description:
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Software Defect Dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files

    train.csv - the training dataset; defects is the binary target, which is treated as a boolean (False=0, True=1)
    test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive defects (i.e., defects=True)
    sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

train.csv - column name: id, loc, v(g), ev(g), iv(g), n, v, l, d, i, e, b, t, lOCode, lOComment, lOBlank, locCodeAndComment, uniq_Op, uniq_Opnd, total_Op, total_Opnd, branchCount, defects
test.csv - column name: id, loc, v(g), ev(g), iv(g), n, v, l, d, i, e, b, t, lOCode, lOComment, lOBlank, locCodeAndComment, uniq_Op, uniq_Opnd, total_Op, total_Opnd, branchCount


## Dataset folder Location: 
../../kaggle-data/playground-series-s3e23. In this folder, there are the following files you can use: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv

## Solution Description:
First of all, I would like to start with a big thank you to Kaggle for running this episode of the playground series. In this post, I will briefly explain my approach, which most of it can be found in my notebook.
### Pre-processing
Initially, I modeled the data without any transformation, which produce a descent CV and LB score (about 0.793 CV score and 0.790 LB score). Then, I log-transform all of the input features as suggested by @ambrosm in this post. The surprising factor here was that there was a small improvement in model performance in most of the tree-based and boosted-tree models that I considered after the inputs were log-transformed.  
Models & Ensemble
In my notebook, I trained the following models:

    Random Forest
    Extra Trees 
    HistGradientBoosting
    LightGBM
    XGBoost
    CatBoost

I ensemble those six models with hill climbing ensemble, which gave me a 0.7907 LB score as shown below.

Then, in order to increase the diversity of the ensemble, I ensemble the hill climbing ensemble (of the six tree-based models) with the Nystr√∂m LogisticRegression model presented in this notebook. This boost my LB score from 0.7907 to 0.79099 as shown below.

Finally, I decided to include neural network model to the ensemble, which was inspired this notebook from @sauravpandey11. This boost my LB score from 0.79099 to 0.79101 as shown below.

Just directly write the code and include necessary comments. Don't output other thing. Now write you code here.
