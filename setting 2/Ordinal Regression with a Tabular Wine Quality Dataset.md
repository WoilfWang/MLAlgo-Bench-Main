##  Evaluation Metric:
Submissions are scored based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.
The quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as follows. First, an N x N histogram matrix O is constructed, such that Oi,j corresponds to the number of Ids i (actual) that received a predicted value j. An N-by-N matrix of weights, w, is calculated based on the difference between actual and predicted values:
w_{i,j} = \frac{\left(i-j\right)^2}{\left(N-1\right)^2}

An N-by-N histogram matrix of expected outcomes, E, is calculated assuming that there is no correlation between values.  This is calculated as the outer product between the actual histogram vector of outcomes and the predicted histogram vector, normalized such that E and O have the same sum.

From these three matrices, the quadratic weighted kappa is calculated as: 
\kappa=1-\frac{\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}O_{i,j}}{\sum_{i,j}w_{i,j}E_{i,j}}.

Submission File

For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target quality. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

    Id,quality
    2056,5
    2057,7
    2058,3
    etc.

##  Dataset Description:
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Wine Quality dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

#### Files

    train.csv - the training dataset; quality is the target (ordinal, integer)
    test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict quality
    sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

train.csv - column name: Id, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality
test.csv - column name: Id, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol


## Dataset folder Location: 
../../kaggle-data/playground-series-s3e5. In this folder, there are the following files you can use: train.csv, test.csv, sample_submission.csv

## Solution Description:
Hello everyone! 
First, I would like to thank the Kaggle team for the competition. I have been learning a lot in these competitions, which is helping me sharpen my skills!
Unlike other solutions I saw in the Discussion for this competition, I did not use an ensemble. My solution was quite simple but effective (single xgboost model). I worked hard on the first two days of the competition to build a good baseline with a good CV.

#### Training and Validation (CV) 
For the CV, I used StratifiedKFold due to the imbalance, and I tuned the K based on some submissions to get the public score and check with my local CV. I started with K=5, but in the end, I saw that K=10 was more reliable with my experiments, then K=10 was my final hparam.

####  Model (RAPIDS XGBoost - GPU)
I always start with some standard models, like lgbm, xgboost, or catboost. For this competition, I wanted to have the best model as soon as possible because I wanted to iterate fast, so I started with the ** RAPIDS XGBoost**. For training, I used Kaggle GPUs (Thanks!). (xgb objective 'objective': 'reg:squarederror', 'tree_method': 'gpu_hist', early_stopping_rounds=50, 'num_boost_round': 1000). For the test set, I used the ntree_limit=model.best_iteration. The others hparams I will provide the others when I have time to clean the code and release the notebook! :)

#### Regression Optimise Class Cutoff
I would like to thank the discussions and public code available that I used to build my solution. One that I remember was the Regression_OptimiseClassCutoff from @paddykb and https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e5/discussion/382525 from @abhishek (discussion: @carlmcbrideellis ) (I used the class OptimizedRounder doing my hyperparameter tuning). As the data distribution shift on my studies was not that high between train/test, I fit for every fold the optimizerRound on the validation predictions to get the cutoff for the test set. After the division by the number of folds, the predictions were float, so I used .round().astype(int) before submitting.

#### Hyperparameters Tuning (Optuna) 
For tuning the model, I used Optuna (where I played a lot with the ranges of the hparams and the number of trials). The metric that I was optimizing was cohen_kappa_score(weights='quadratic') on my train oof after the cutoff.

#### TL;DR 
- RAPIDS:XGBOOST + SKFold10 + Optuna + Regression Class Cutoff (I trusted my local CV to select the two final models)..
