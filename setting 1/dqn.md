You should implement Q-Function loss using python, numpy, and pytorch from scratch. We provide the GPU that can be used for training or inference.
I will provide you with a description of the algorithm module, and you should implement it strictly according to this description. 
 

## Train the model

We want to find optimal action-value function.

\begin{align}
        Q^*(s,a) &= \max_\pi \mathbb{E} \Big[
            r_t + \gamma r_{t + 1} + \gamma^2 r_{t + 2} + ... | s_t = s, a_t = a, \pi
        \Big]
    \\
        Q^*(s,a) &= \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{s' \sim \large{\varepsilon}} \Big[
            r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^* (s', a') | s, a
        \Big]
\end{align}

### Target network ðŸŽ¯
In order to improve stability we use experience replay that randomly sample
    from previous experience $U(D)$. We also use a Q network
    with a separate set of parameters $\textcolor{orange}{\theta_i^{-}}$ to calculate the target.
    $\textcolor{orange}{\theta_i^{-}}$ is updated periodically.
    

So the loss function is,
    $$
    \mathcal{L}_i(\theta_i) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim U(D)}
    \bigg[
        \Big(
            r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \textcolor{orange}{\theta_i^{-}}) - Q(s,a;\theta_i)
        \Big) ^ 2
    \bigg]
    $$

### Double $Q$-Learning
The max operator in the above calculation uses same network for both
    selecting the best action and for evaluating the value.
    That is,
    $$
    \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta) = \textcolor{cyan}{Q}
    \Big(
        s', \mathop{\operatorname{argmax}}_{a'}
        \textcolor{cyan}{Q}(s', a'; \textcolor{cyan}{\theta}); \textcolor{cyan}{\theta}
    \Big)
    $$
    We use [double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461), where
    the $\operatorname{argmax}$ is taken from $\textcolor{cyan}{\theta_i}$ and
    the value is taken from $\textcolor{orange}{\theta_i^{-}}$.

And the loss function becomes,

\begin{align}
        \mathcal{L}_i(\theta_i) = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{(s,a,r,s') \sim U(D)}
        \Bigg[
            \bigg(
                &r + \gamma \textcolor{orange}{Q}
                \Big(
                    s',
                    \mathop{\operatorname{argmax}}_{a'}
                        \textcolor{cyan}{Q}(s', a'; \textcolor{cyan}{\theta_i}); \textcolor{orange}{\theta_i^{-}}
                \Big)
                \\
                - &Q(s,a;\theta_i)
            \bigg) ^ 2
        \Bigg]
\end{align}

The module should be named QFuncLoss.
The init function needs to include the following parameters:
gamma (float): The discount factor, which is used to discount future rewards.

The module needs to include at least the following functions:
1. forward: forward propagation function. 
It should include the following parameters:
q (torch.Tensor): The Q-values from the current Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta_i)$, with shape [batch\_size, action\_space];
action (torch.Tensor): The indices of the actions taken in the respective states, with shape [batch\_size]. Each element is the index of the action chosen for the corresponding state;
double_q (torch.Tensor): The Q-values from the current Q-network $Q(s, a; \theta_i)$, used to select the next action $Q(s{\prime}; \theta_i)$;
target_q (torch.Tensor): The Q-values from the target network $Q(s{\prime}; \theta_i^{-})$, used to evaluate the value of the best action chosen at the next state;
done (torch.Tensor): A flag indicating whether the episode has ended. It has shape [batch\_size], with each element being a boolean that indicates whether the current state is terminal;
reward (torch.Tensor): The reward received after taking the action, with shape [batch\_size], where each element represents the reward for the respective state-action pair;
weights (torch.Tensor): The weights of the samples from the prioritized experience replay, used for weighting the loss during training
It should return:
td_error (torch.Tensor): The Temporal Difference (TD) error, which is the difference between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value. This error is used to update the Q-network;
loss (torch.Tensor): The weighted loss, computed using the Huber loss. This is the value that is minimized during training to improve the Q-network.

You just need to implement the algorithm module; no need to provide corresponding examples.
