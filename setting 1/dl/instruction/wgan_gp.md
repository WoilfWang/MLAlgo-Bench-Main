You should implement the Gradient Penalty for Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) using Python and PyTorch from scratch. We provide the GPU that can be used for training or inference.
I will provide you with a description of the algorithm module, and you should implement it strictly according to this description. 


The goal of Wasserstein GAN is to minimize the Wasserstein distance (also known as Earth Mover's distance) between the generated distribution  $\mathbb{P}_g $ and the real distribution  $\mathbb{P}_r$ . The WGAN-GP algorithm replaces weight clipping in the WGAN loss function with a gradient penalty to better maintain the 1-Lipschitz constraint.
$$\mathcal{L}_{GP} = \lambda \underset{\hat{x} \sim \mathbb{P}_{\hat{x}}}{\mathbb{E}}
\Big[ \big(\Vert \nabla_{\hat{x}} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1\big)^2 \Big]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the penalty weight and

\begin{align}
x &\sim \mathbb{P}_r \\
z &\sim p(z) \\
\epsilon &\sim U[0,1] \\
\tilde{x} &\leftarrow G_\theta (z) \\
\hat{x} &\leftarrow \epsilon x + (1 - \epsilon) \tilde{x}
\end{align}

That is we try to keep the gradient norm $\Vert \nabla_{\hat{x}} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2$ close to $1$.

In this implementation we set $\epsilon = 1$.

The model needs to include at least the following class:
1.Gradient Penalty:This class calculates the gradient penalty term for the WGAN-GP algorithm to ensure the discriminator satisfies the 1-Lipschitz continuity constraint.
The module should be named GradientPenalty.
The init function shouldn't include any parameters.
The class needs to include at least the following function:
forward:forward propagation function. It should include the following parameters:
 x: tensors,is x \sim \mathbb{P}_r. It has the shape of [bs, 1, 28, 28];
 f: tensors,is D(x). It has the shapf of [bs, 1].
The return of forward function includes:
the loss $\big(\Vert \nabla_{\hat{x}} D(\hat{x}) \Vert_2 - 1\big)^2.$

You just need to implement the algorithm module; no need to provide corresponding examples.
