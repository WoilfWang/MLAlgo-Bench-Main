You should implement Patches Are All You Need? (ConvMixer) using Python and PyTorch from scratch. We provide the GPU that can be used for training or inference.
I will provide you with a description of the algorithm module, and you should implement it strictly according to this description. 


The ConvMixer model is designed for efficient and scalable image classification tasks. It combines the simplicity of convolutional networks with the effectiveness of modern deep learning techniques. ConvMixer is Similar to MLP-Mixer, MLP-Mixer separates mixing of spatial and channel dimensions, by applying an MLP across spatial dimension and then an MLP across the channel dimension (spatial MLP replaces the ViT attention and channel MLP is the FFN of ViT).
ConvMixer uses a 1 \times 1 convolution for channel mixing and a depth-wise convolution for spatial mixing. Since it's a convolution instead of a full MLP across the space, it mixes only the nearby batches in contrast to ViT or MLP-Mixer. Also, the MLP-mixer uses MLPs of two layers for each mixing and ConvMixer uses a single layer for each mixing.
Key Components of ConvMixer:
Convolutional Layer: The main building block of ConvMixer is the standard convolutional layer which performs spatial mixing of the input data.
Activation Function: The ReLU activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the model.
Batch Normalization: This helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process by normalizing the inputs of each layer.
Residual Connections: These connections help in training deeper networks by allowing gradients to flow through the network more easily.
The ConvMixer architecture can be summarized as follows:
It consists of multiple stages, each containing several ConvMixer layers.
Each ConvMixer layer includes a depthwise convolution followed by pointwise convolution.
Depthwise convolutions are applied independently to each input channel, while pointwise convolutions mix the information across channels.

The model needs to include at least the following classes:

1. ConvMixer Layer.
The module should be named ConvMixerLayer.
This is a single ConvMixer layer.
The init function needs to include the following parameters:
d_model: is the number of channels in patch embeddings;
kernel_size: is the size of the kernel of spatial convolution, k.
The forward function needs to include the following parameters:
x: Input tensor of shape [batch_size, d_model, height, width]
The return of forward function includes:
Output tensor after applying depthwise and pointwise convolutions with residual connections.

2. patch embeddings
The module should be named ConvPatchEmbeddings.
This splits the image into patches of size [p, p] and gives an embedding for each patch.
The init function needs to include the following parameters:
d_model: is the number of channels in patch embeddings h
patch_size: is the size of the patch, p
in_channels: is the number of channels in the input image (3 for rgb)
The forward function needs to include the following parameters:
x: Input image tensor of shape [batch_size, in_channels, height, width].
The return of forward function includes:
Patch embeddings tensor of shape [batch_size, d_model, height / patch_size, width / patch_size].

3. Classification Head
The module should be named ConvClassificationHead.
They do average pooling (taking the mean of all patch embeddings) and a final linear transformation to predict the log-probabilities of the image classes.
The init function needs to include the following parameters:
d_model: is the number of channels in patch embeddings, h
n_classes: is the number of classes in the classification task
The forward function(.)needs to include the following parameters:
x: Input tensor of shape [batch_size, d_model, height, width].
The return of forward function includes:
Output tensor of shape [batch_size, n_classes] containing class logits.

4. ConvMixer.
The module should be named ConvMixer.
This combines the patch embeddings block, a number of ConvMixer layers and a classification head.
The init function needs to include the following parameters:
conv_mixer_layer: An instance of a single ConvMixerLayer. from LLMConvMixer import ConvMixerLayer
n_layers: The number of ConvMixer layers.
patch_emb: An instance of the PatchEmbeddings class. from LLMConvMixer import PatchEmbeddings
classification: An instance of the ClassificationHead class. from LLMConvMixer import ClassificationHead
The forward function needs to include the following parameters:
x: Input image tensor of shape [batch_size, channels, height, width].
The return of forward function includes:
Output tensor of shape [batch_size, n_classes] containing class logits.

You just need to implement the algorithm module; no need to provide corresponding examples.
