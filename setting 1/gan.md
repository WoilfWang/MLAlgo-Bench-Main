You should implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Python and PyTorch from scratch. We provide the GPU that can be used for training or inference.
I will provide you with a description of the algorithm module, and you should implement it strictly according to this description. 


GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. They consist of two neural networks, the Generator and the Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through adversarial processes. The Generator tries to produce realistic data to fool the Discriminator, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. This competition leads to the Generator producing increasingly realistic data over time.

The generator, $G(\pmb{z}; \theta_g)$ generates samples that match the
distribution of data, while the discriminator, $D(\pmb{x}; \theta_g)$
gives the probability that $\pmb{x}$ came from data rather than $G$.

We train $D$ and $G$ simultaneously on a two-player min-max game with value
function $V(G, D)$.

$$\min_G \max_D V(D, G) =
    \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{\pmb{x} \sim p_{data}(\pmb{x})}
        \big[\log D(\pmb{x})\big] +
    \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{\pmb{z} \sim p_{\pmb{z}}(\pmb{z})}
        \big[\log (1 - D(G(\pmb{z}))\big]
$$

$p_{data}(\pmb{x})$ is the probability distribution over data,
whilst $p_{\pmb{z}}(\pmb{z})$ probability distribution of $\pmb{z}$, which is set to
gaussian noise.

The model needs to include at least the following classes:
1.Discriminator Logits Loss
The module should be named DiscriminatorLogitsLoss.
The DiscriminatorLogitsLoss class calculates the loss for the discriminator in a GAN. The discriminator's goal is to distinguish between real data samples and generated (fake) data samples. The loss function for the discriminator encourages it to correctly classify real samples as real and fake samples as fake.
Discriminator Loss
    Discriminator should **ascend** on the gradient,
    $$\nabla_{\theta_d} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Bigg[
        \log D\Big(\pmb{x}^{(i)}\Big) +
        \log \Big(1 - D\Big(G\Big(\pmb{z}^{(i)}\Big)\Big)\Big)
    \Bigg]$$
    $m$ is the mini-batch size and $(i)$ is used to index samples in the mini-batch.
    $\pmb{x}$ are samples from $p_{data}$ and $\pmb{z}$ are samples from $p_z$.
The class needs to include at least the following functions:
The init function needs to include the following parameter:
smoothing (float, default=0.2): The amount of label smoothing to apply. Label smoothing is a  technique that can help stabilize training by preventing the discriminator from becoming too  confident in its predictions.
The forward function needs to include the following parameters:
logits_true: are logits from $D(\pmb{x}^{(i)})$. The shape is [batch_size, 1];
logits_false: are logits from $D(G(\pmb{z}^{(i)}))$. The shape is [batch_size, 1].
Returns: A tuple containing the loss values for real and fake samples.

2.Generator Logits Loss
The module should be named GeneratorLogitsLoss.
The GeneratorLogitsLoss class calculates the loss for the generator in a GAN. The generator's goal is to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, thereby fooling the discriminator.
Generator Loss
    Generator should **descend** on the gradient,
    $$\nabla_{\theta_g} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Bigg[
        \log \Big(1 - D\Big(G\Big(\pmb{z}^{(i)}\Big)\Big)\Big)
    \Bigg]$$
The init function needs to include the following parameter:
smoothing (float, default=0.2): A float value for label smoothing.
The forward function needs to include the following parameter:
logits (torch.Tensor): Logits from $D(G(\pmb{z}^{(i)}))$, where z are noise samples. The shape is [batch_size, 1].
Returns: The loss value for the generator.

You just need to implement the algorithm module; no need to provide corresponding examples.
