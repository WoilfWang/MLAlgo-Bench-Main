Given an instruction about a machine learning algorithm, implement the relevant code based on this instruction.
You should implement the algorithm by using Python, Numpy or Scipy from scratch. You can't use any functions or classes from scikit-learn.
You only need to implement the algorithm module, and you don't need to generate test cases.
You should create as many sub-functions or sub-classes as possible to help you implement the entire algorithm.
Just output the code of the algorithm, don't output anything else.

Instruction:

Implement a ransac regressor for regression with python, numpy and scipy. 
RANSAC is an iterative algorithm for the robust estimation of parameters from a subset of inliers from the complete data set.

### Algorithmic Flow:

1. **Initialize Parameters**:
   - Set the number of iterations \( N \).
   - Define the tolerance threshold \( \epsilon \) for determining inliers.
   - Set the minimum number of inliers required to consider a model valid.

2. **Iterative Process**:
   - For each iteration:
     1. Randomly select a minimal subset of data points.
     2. Fit the model to these points. For linear regression, calculate the line parameters:
        \[
        y = mx + c
        \]
        where \( m \) is the slope and \( c \) is the intercept.
     3. Calculate the residuals for all data points:
        \[
        r_i = |y_i - (mx_i + c)|
        \]
     4. Identify inliers where \( r_i < \epsilon \).
     5. If the number of inliers is greater than the current best model, update the best model.

3. **Select Best Model**:
   - Choose the model with the maximum number of inliers.
   - Optionally, re-fit the model using all inliers to improve accuracy.

### Mathematical Derivation:

For a linear model, the line parameters \( m \) and \( c \) can be derived from two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) as follows:

- Slope \( m \):
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
  \]

- Intercept \( c \):
  \[
  c = y_1 - m \cdot x_1
  \]

RANSAC is particularly useful in scenarios where the dataset contains a significant number of outliers, as it focuses on finding a model that best fits the inliers, thus providing a robust solution.

The module should be named GPTRANSACRegressor.  
The init function should include the following parameters:
estimator: Base estimator object which implements the following methods:fit(X, y): Fit model to given training data and target values;score(X, y): Returns the mean accuracy on the given test data, which is used for the stop criterion defined by stop_score. Additionally, the score is used to decide which of two equally large consensus sets is chosen as the better one. predict(X): Returns predicted values using the linear model, which is used to compute residual error using loss function.
The module must contain a fit function and a predict function.  
The fit function accepts X_train and y_train and return None where  
X_train: the features of the train data, which is a numpy array, and the shape of X_train is [N, d]. N is the number of the train data and d is the dimension.  
y_train: the labels pf the train data,which is a numpy array.  
The predict function accepts X_test as input and return predictions where  
X_test: the features of the test data, which is a numpy array, and the shape of X_train is [N, d]. N is the number of the test data and d is the dimension.  
predctions: the predicted results for X_test, which is a numpy arrary.  
You should just return the code for the module, don't return anything else.
