Implement the spectral co-clustering algorithm with python, numpy and scipy. 
Clusters rows and columns of an array `X` to solve the relaxed normalized cut of the bipartite graph created from `X` as follows: the edge between row vertex `i` and column vertex `j` has weight `X[i, j]`. The resulting bicluster structure is block-diagonal, since each row and each column belongs to exactly one bicluster. Supports sparse matrices, as long as they are nonnegative.  

The main idea behind spectral co-clustering is to use the spectral properties (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of matrices derived from the data matrix to perform clustering. The goal is to simultaneously cluster rows and columns in such a way that the resulting blocks (submatrices) are as dense as possible, indicating high similarity within each block and low similarity across different blocks.

### Algorithmic Flow

1. **Input Data Matrix**: Consider a data matrix \( A \) of size \( m \times n \), where \( m \) is the number of rows (e.g., documents) and \( n \) is the number of columns (e.g., terms).

2. **Normalization**: Normalize the matrix to make the rows and columns comparable. A common approach is to use the normalized cut. Define the diagonal matrices \( D_r \) and \( D_c \) where \( D_r(i, i) = \sum_j A(i, j) \) and \( D_c(j, j) = \sum_i A(i, j) \). Then, compute the normalized matrix:
   \[
   B = D_r^{-1/2} A D_c^{-1/2}
   \]

3. **Construct the Laplacian Matrix**: The Laplacian matrix for co-clustering is defined as:
   \[
   L = I - B
   \]
   where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This matrix captures the difference between the identity and the normalized data matrix, emphasizing the dissimilarities.

4. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( L \). The smallest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors will be used for clustering, as they represent the least cuts (or separations) in the data.

5. **Select Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Choose the top \( k \) smallest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. The choice of \( k \) depends on the desired number of clusters.

6. **Form the Feature Matrix**: Construct a feature matrix \( F \) using the selected eigenvectors. Rows of \( F \) represent the original rows of \( A \) projected into a lower-dimensional space defined by the eigenvectors.

7. **Clustering**: Apply a standard clustering algorithm (like k-means) to the rows of \( F \) to cluster the original rows. Similarly, cluster the columns by applying the clustering algorithm to the columns of \( F \).

8. **Result**: The output is a set of co-clusters, where each co-cluster is defined by a subset of rows and a subset of columns from the original matrix \( A \).

The module should be named GPTSpectralCoClustering.  
The init function should include the following parameters:
n_clusters: The number of biclusters to find.
The module must contain a fit_predict function.  
The fit_predict function accepts X as input and return labels where  
X: X is the features of the data, which is a numpy array and it's shape is [N, d]. N is the number of the train data and d is the dimension.  
labels: A numpy array of shape (n_samples,) containing the index of the cluster each sample belongs to.  
You should just return the code for the module, don't return anything else.
