You should implement the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks using Python and PyTorch from scratch. We provide the GPU that can be used for training or inference.
I will provide you with a description of the algorithm module, and you should implement it strictly according to this description. 


DCGANs are a type of GAN architecture that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in both the generator and the discriminator. This architecture has been shown to be particularly effective in generating realistic images. DCGAN stands for Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, a GAN variant that uses deep convolutional layers to improve the quality of generated images. It consists of two main components:Generator (G): Takes a random noise vector as input and generates a fake image.Discriminator (D): Takes an image as input (real or fake) and outputs the probability that the image is real.
Training Process:
Discriminator Training:
Real Image Loss: Train the discriminator to correctly classify real images as real.
Fake Image Loss: Train the discriminator to correctly classify generated (fake) images as fake.
Generator Training:
Train the generator to fool the discriminator, i.e., make the discriminator classify fake images as real.
The loss functions used are Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss for both the discriminator and the generator.
Key Features:
Use of strided convolutions and transpose convolutions for downsampling and upsampling respectively.
Batch normalization to stabilize training.
LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator to prevent the "dying ReLU" problem.
Tanh activation in the generator's output layer to ensure output pixel values are in the range [-1, 1].

The model needs to include at least the following classes:
1.Convolutional Generator Network.
The module should be named Generator.
The init function initializes the generator network.
The forward function(Forward propagation method for generating images from noise.)needs to include the following parameters:
x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape [batch_size, 100]
The return of forward function includes:
x: Output tensor of shape [batch_size, 1, 28, 28]
2.Convolutional Discriminator Network
The module should be named Discriminator.
The init function initializes the discriminator network layers.
The forward function(Forward propagation method)needs to include the following parameter:
x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape [batch_size, 1, 28, 28].
The return of forward function includes:
x : Output tensor of shape [batch_size, 1]

You just need to implement the algorithm module; no need to provide corresponding examples.
